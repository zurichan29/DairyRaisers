                        Processing Center is the first of its kind in the Province of Cavite and, most likely, the
                        entire CALABARZON Region, and was made possible by the collaboration of the General Trias Local
                        Government, the General Trias Dairy Raisers Multi-Purpose Cooperative (GTDRMPC), the Korea
                        International Cooperation Agency (KOICA), and the Philippine Carabao Center (PCC) of the
                        Department of Agriculture. This multi-million project is outfitted with cutting-edge
                        medium-scale machinery capable of processing 500 liters of raw milk every batch, which can meet
                        the town's expanding carabao milk output and collection.</p>

                        General Trias Dairy Raisers Multi-Purpose Cooperative (GTDRMPC) is at the core of Gentri's Best.
                        It was created and registered on August 10, 2005, primarily to promote dairying and dairy
                        entrepreneurship in order to enhance the quality of life of Carabao raisers.</p>

                        began operations in 2005 in a kitchen-style processing center with one donated freezer and
                        self-acquired culinary supplies. It is administered and run by coop members who frequently
                        participate in capacity-building programs organized by its partner organizations such as the PCC
                        at UPLB, the Municipal Agriculture Office, and the DTI-Cavite. It currently produces 21 dairy
                        products and taste variants, including fresh milk, flavored milk, white cheese, pastillas,
                        yoghurt, milk-o-gel, ice candy, and yema, up from seven (7) previously.</p>
