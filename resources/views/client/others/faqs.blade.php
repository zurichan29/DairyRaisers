                        ðŸ¥› Delivery times differ depending on the area. We typically start our deliveries at 8 am and
                        end at 6 pm.

                        ðŸ¥› Yes, we sure do. We donâ€™t operate off a set-price list. A pricing structure is prepared
                        specifically for each individual customer based on the quantity and range of products.

                        <strong>What is the right temperature at which to <br> store milk?</strong>
                    </h2>
                    <p class="">
                        ðŸ¥› Milk should be stored at or below 2Â° C to ensure it stays fresh for as long as possible. Storage
                        above this temperature will drastically reduce the shelf life of the milk. If you leave milk on
                        the counter for 1 hour, it loses as much freshness as it does one day in the refrigerator.
